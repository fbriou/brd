# BRD - Photo Management Application

## Overview

BRD is a modern photo management application similar to Google Photos, built entirely on AWS serverless architecture. It provides a secure, scalable, and maintainable solution for handling your photo collection.

### Key Features
- ðŸ“¸ Easy photo upload and management
- ðŸ”’ Secure storage with AWS S3
- ðŸ‘¤ User authentication and access control
- ðŸ“± RESTful API for seamless integration
- ðŸš€ Serverless architecture for optimal scaling

## Quick Start

Want to get started quickly? Here's what you need:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18.x
   - AWS CLI
   - Terraform
   - Serverless Framework
   - AWS Account with appropriate permissions

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone and install
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd brd
   npm install

   # Configure AWS
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Deploy (Development Environment)**
   ```bash
   # Deploy infrastructure
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   terraform apply

   # Deploy application
   serverless deploy --stage dev
   ```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

#### Database
- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Primary database for storing application data
- **Migration System**: Automated database migration management
- **Data Integrity**: Version-controlled schema changes with rollback capabilities

#### Serverless Architecture
- **AWS Lambda**: Core business logic implemented as serverless functions
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints for photo management
- **S3 Storage**: Secure and scalable photo storage solution
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **AWS Cognito**: User authentication and management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions system
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure API access management
- **Custom Middlewares**: Request validation and authorization checks

## Detailed Setup

### Infrastructure Deployment

The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices. This ensures:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Consistent environments
- Easy replication of infrastructure
- Automated resource management

Before deploying the application, you need to:
1. Set up your AWS account and configure credentials
2. Create the S3 bucket for photo storage
3. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform

[View detailed infrastructure setup guide â†’](terraform/README.md)

### Environments

Two environments are supported:
- Development
- Production

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Deploy the application:**
   ```bash
   serverless deploy --stage dev
   # or
   serverless deploy --stage prod
   ```

2. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   serverless invoke --function migrate --stage dev
   # or
   serverless invoke --function migrate --stage prod
   ```

## API Documentation

The API provides endpoints for:
- Health checks
- Photo upload
- Photo listing
- Photo deletion
- User management

All endpoints (except `/health`) require AWS Cognito authentication and appropriate permissions.
